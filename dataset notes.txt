Our dataset provides all shots taken in the 2014-2015 season, distributed publicly on Kaggle. Has tons of information to predict whether a player is a good shooter. But in our context, to determine whether or not a shot will be a make or miss. 

The only problem I feel this dataset has to our problem is no information on individual players. Different players have different percentages to their field goal rating. With these numbers, our model could predict POSSIBLY with more accuracy whether or not a shot would hit. SO, we created a players.csv from basketball-reference.com for all the players that played in the 2014-2015 season. (Don't really know how we can use this data [personally LOL]).

game_id = useless

matchup = useless

Location = might matter, but very minuscule

Win/Lose = useless

Final Margin = useless

shot_number = may factor into fatigue, etc. Too many shots may lead to mindset adjustment 	etc. Useful stat

Period
Game_clock = period/game_clock very correlated, and can be combined so that it's more linear/one variable. Also need to convert this to a number. ex. Instead of 1:09, it would be in seconds or something. Doesn't really matter. AND it should have like a total time of 48:00 (48 mins in a game)
Shot_clock = nice because players may feel the pressure

Dribbles = first glance, I feel as if fewer dribbles = a higher chance of the shot going in. Because shots off the dribble are difficult. OR it could mean that a person has more touches and is more familiar with the ball.

touch_time = the ideas of the last feature. A person who touched the ball less may not be ready to shoot the ball

Shot dist = lower dist is an easier shot

pts type = 2 easier than 3?

Shot result = keep to calculate accuracy. Change to boolean

Closest defender = useless, not enough data to determine if a player determines shot accuracy (maybe with def ratings etc in the future)

Close def distance = can be useful. Lower dist, harder shot

Fgm = or shot result, pick one

pts = useless

Player name = correlated with our players.csv, maybe we can determine if a certain player can have a higher accuracy
